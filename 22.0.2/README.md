# IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation 22.0.2 Labs

To be able to perform these labs, you need to have IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation (either Enterprise or Starter pattern) installed and have imported the Client Onboarding scenario as described [here](https://github.com/IBM/cp4ba-client-onboarding-scenario).

One way to deploy an IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation Enterprise pattern cluster is to use the rapid deployment scripts as describes [here](https://github.com/IBM/cp4ba-rapid-deployment). A fast way for Business Partners and IBMers with access to IBM TechZone, is to utilize [Jam-in-a-Box](http://ibm.biz/Jam-in-a-Box) with its associated environment.

The table below lists all capabilities for which labs are available. A capability may contain one or more labs depending on the complexity.
