# Readme for Self paced Content Lab variants

These variants of the Content Lab documents are meant for usage with the Jam-in-a-box offering. 
They contain the same exercises, but with minor changes because of different names of the FileNet 
Domain, the Object Store used for the Content lab, and the security settings in that Object store.
